Core API Layer Project
This repository serves as the foundational layer for a modern, scalable Node.js REST API. It establishes a professional project structure, standardized response contracts, and integrated API documentation out-of-the-box, providing a robust starting point for any new service.

Features
Structured & Scalable: Logical separation of concerns for API logic, middleware, and configuration.
Versioned API: All core endpoints are nested under /api/v1 to allow for future versions without breaking changes.
Standardized Responses: A consistent JSON contract for all success and error responses.
Integrated Documentation: Live, interactive API documentation powered by OpenAPI and Swagger UI.
Centralized Error Handling: Graceful error handling that prevents stack traces from leaking.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project set up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version is recommended)
npm (comes installed with Node.js)
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd core-api-project
Install dependencies:

npm install
Configure environment variables: Create a file named .env in the root of the project and add the following content. This file is ignored by Git and should not contain sensitive secrets in a public repository.

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
Start the server:

npm start
(Note: You may need to add "start": "node src/server.js" to the scripts section of your package.json file).

You should see a confirmation message in your terminal: API listening on http://localhost:3000

Project Structure
The project follows a feature-oriented structure designed for maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

API Documentation
This API is documented using the OpenAPI 3.0 standard. We use Swagger UI to provide live, interactive documentation where you can explore and test every endpoint directly from your browser.

How to Access the Docs
Ensure the server is running (npm start).
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/api/docs
From this interface, you can see all available endpoints, their required parameters, and their response shapes. You can also execute requests against your live local server using the "Try it out" feature.

API Response Contract
All API responses, whether success or error, follow a standardized JSON structure to ensure consistency and predictability.

Success Response
Successful requests will return a JSON object with a success flag set to true and a data payload.

Shape: { "success": true, "data": {…} }
HTTP Status: 200 OK
Example:

{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "version": "v1",
    "ok": true
  }
}
Error Response
Failed requests will return a JSON object with a success flag set to false and an error object containing details.

Shape: { "success": false, "error": { "message": "...", "code": "..." } }
HTTP Status: 4xx or 5xx error codes.
Example (404 Not Found):

{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "message": "API route not found.",
        "code": "NOT_FOUND"
    }
}
